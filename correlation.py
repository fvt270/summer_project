    """Rank order a dataset. The lowest value has rank 1.

    Ties are averaged so that equal values receive the same rank:

        >>> _rank(data)
        [3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 6.0, 1.0]

    It is possible to rank the data in reverse order so that the
    highest value has rank 1.  Also, a key-function can extract
    the field to be ranked:

    Ranks are conventionally numbered starting from one; however,
    setting *start* to zero allows the ranks to be used as array indices:

        >>> [prize[int(i)] for i in _rank(scores, start=0, reverse=True)]
